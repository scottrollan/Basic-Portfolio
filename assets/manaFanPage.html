    <h2>Bio</h2>
        <p>
            Maná is the quintessential Spanish-language rock band and, without a doubt, helped define what "rock en tu idioma" (rock in your language) is today.  Fusing mainly funk, reggae, ska, bolero, and various Latin rhythms mixed with pure rock, they have created numerous musical pieces recognizable throughout the Spanish-speaking world and beyond.  The core musical group that is Maná has been around since the 1980's, but they really gained universal fame in 1997 with the release of it's CD, <em>Sueños Liquidos</em>.

            Maná has received astounding recognition, including 133 gold records, 256 platinum records, and more than 48 No. 1 hits worldwide. Not only have they been lauded for their musical accomplishments, but for philanthropic, humanitarian, social, political and environmental endeavors as well.  If there is a "first Latin rock band to do something," it's pobably Maná.
