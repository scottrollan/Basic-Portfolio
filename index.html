        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <img src="assets/images/gunKiss.jpg" class="mainPic">
        <p>I'm Barry&#58; a professional hair stylist&#44; teacher of English&#44; and now&#44; web developer.  Learning to master new and&#44; often difficult&#44; skills has been a life&#8208;long penchant for me. My favorite thing is to learn and apply that learning, even if it&#39;s just for fun.</p>
        <p>I'll have to figure out what all these words will be later. I'm super duper excited about writing it--I just don't knwo what to say just yet. Any ideas would be appreciated. I mean, is this supposed to be a 100% professional About Me or can I include other facts like in the following paragraph.</p>
        <p>I love love love gardening with native plants. My best Sundays end with me doing a load of muddy laundry from a day spent digging, planting, mulching and weeding my landscape. I also have two dogs and two cats currently, but I think I've always had at least one pet and that takes up a lot of my free time, especially the dogs.</p>
